üöÄ NULL POINT ‚Äî Ultimate DLL Injector ‚Äî Sanitized Public README: NULL POINT is a research & educational project demonstrating high-level concepts of Windows process interaction and module management for authorized researchers and developers; this public README is intentionally non-actionable and omits any runnable or operational instructions. Features (high-level): Auto-detection of configured modules (presentation only), process listing & selection UI (non-actionable), single-button execution model (UI-only), red & black theme, real-time status & logging (UI presentation); Engine (conceptual): multiple demonstration techniques, modular architecture, safe resource-management concepts, extensible design for authorized testing; Safety & reliability (high-level): validation & safety checks (conceptual), robust error handling & logging, intended for use only with explicit authorization. Quick notes: clone the repo and consult internal/private docs for any build/run details if you are an authorized contributor; do not run scripts or executables on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. UI overview (presentation only): SELECT PROCESS dropdown, SELECT MODULE dropdown, INJECTION METHOD selection (conceptual), EXECUTE button, real-time logs and status panel. Injection methods listed here are conceptual and non-actionable (standard API approach concept, manual-mapping concept, thread/context-manipulation concept) ‚Äî no implementation details provided. Technical architecture (conceptual): AdvancedInjector (process discovery, module management, execution workflow at UI level, logging & error handling) and core components described at a high level (process scanner, module validator, memory-management concept, error handler, UI engine). System requirements (informational): Windows 10/11 (64-bit), Python 3.8+ (informational), 4 GB RAM minimum (8 GB+ recommended), 50 MB free storage; administrative privileges may be required for some authorized research workflows ‚Äî obtain explicit permission.
