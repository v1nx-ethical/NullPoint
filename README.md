Operational instructions that could be used for unauthorized activities have been removed. If you are an authorized maintainer and need runnable/internal docs, keep them in a **private** repository or an access‑controlled document. --- ## 📖 Table of Contents - [Overview](#overview) - [Features](#features) - [Quick Start (Sanitized)](#quick-start-sanitized) - [Installation (Sanitized)](#installation-sanitized) - [Usage Guide (Sanitized)](#usage-guide-sanitized) - [Injection Methods (High-level)](#injection-methods-high-level) - [Technical Details (Non-actionable)](#technical-details-non-actionable) - [System Requirements](#system-requirements) - [Legal Disclaimer](#legal-disclaimer) - [Credits](#credits) - [Changelog](#changelog) --- ## 🎯 Overview **NULL POINT** is a research and educational project demonstrating concepts related to process interaction and module management on Windows platforms. This repository is intended for **authorized educational use only** and is targeted at security researchers, educators, and developers working in controlled, legal environments. --- ## ✨ Features ### 🎨 User Experience (High-level) - Auto-detection of configured modules (presentation only) - Process listing and selection UI (non-actionable description) - Single-button execution model in the UI (presentation only) - Professional red & black UI theme - Real-time status and logging display (UI presentation) ### ⚡ Engine (High-level) - Multiple demonstration techniques (conceptual) - Modular architecture and safe memory-handling concepts (descriptive) - Extensible design for research and authorized testing ### 🛡️ Safety & Reliability (High-level) - Built-in validation and safety checks (conceptual) - Robust error handling and logging (presentation) - Intended to be used only with explicit authorization --- ## 🚀 Quick Start (Sanitized) > This section does **not** contain runnable or operational instructions. It provides a high‑level contributor workflow. 1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 2. Create an isolated Python environment (recommended). 3. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. 4. Refer to internal/private documentation for run/build/testing steps (authorization required). --- ## 📥 Installation (Sanitized) > The public README omits any commands that would directly run or deploy the software. Below are **safe** example steps to prepare a development environment. Replace placeholders with your internal instructions if you have proper authorization. ```bash # Clone the repository (example) git clone https://github.com/your-username/null-point.git cd null-point # Create a Python virtual environment (example) python -m venv .venv # Activate the environment: # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate # Install dependencies from requirements.txt (example) pip install -r requirements.txt ``` > ⚠️ **Do not** run any scripts or executables from this repository on systems you do not own or have explicit authorization to test. --- ## 🎮 Usage Guide (Sanitized) This public README provides a UI/UX overview only. All operational and step‑by‑step instructions that could be used to perform or enable injection have been removed. ### UI Overview (presentation) ``` [NULL POINT Interface] ├── SELECT PROCESS dropdown (auto-populated) ├── SELECT MODULE dropdown (auto-scanned) ├── INJECTION METHOD selection (conceptual) ├── EXECUTE button (UI) └── Real-time logs and status panel ``` ### Visual elements - Dropdowns: display available targets and modules (UI-only) - Radio/select: choose demonstration technique (no operational detail) - Logs: color-coded informational display (presentation) --- ## ⚡ Injection Methods (High-level) > The following is strictly conceptual and intentionally non‑actionable. 1. **Standard API approach** — a conceptual description of using platform APIs for module interaction. 2. **Manual mapping (concept)** — an advanced research topic described at a high level only. 3. **Thread/context manipulation (concept)** — an advanced research topic mentioned without operational detail. --- ## 🛠️ Technical Details (Non-actionable) ### 🏗️ Architecture (Conceptual) ``` AdvancedInjector (conceptual) ├── Process discovery (conceptual) ├── Module management (conceptual) ├── Execution workflow (UI-level) └── Logging & error handling (presentation) ``` ### 🔧 Core Components (Descriptions) - **Process Scanner:** Enumerates running processes for display only. - **Module Validator:** Performs validation checks at a conceptual level. - **Memory Manager:** Architectural notes on disciplined resource management. - **Error Handler:** Categorizes and logs errors for diagnostics. - **UI Engine:** Uses a GUI framework (presentation only). --- ## 📊 System Requirements ### ✅ Minimum Requirements (Informational) - **OS:** Windows 10/11 (64-bit) — informational only - **Python:** 3.8+ (informational) - **RAM:** 4 GB minimum - **Storage:** 50 MB free - **Permissions:** Administrative privileges may be required for certain authorized test workflows — obtain explicit permission ### ✅ Recommended Specs - **OS:** Windows 11 (64-bit) - **Python:** 3.10+ - **RAM:** 8 GB+ - **CPU:** Multi‑core processor --- ## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer > **IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY** This project is intended for **EDUCATIONAL AND AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**.
